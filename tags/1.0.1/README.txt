I would like to thank the following:
- The Transmission Project (http://www.transmissionbt.com/) as it helped me greatly in getting some ideas, and solving some issues.
- "Hadley Rouse" (Redditor licenseplate <redditorlicenseplate [at] gmail [dot] com>) for the great icon!

And also anyone who will submit handy bug report, know that I will thank you too! :D
